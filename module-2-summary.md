# CHECKLIST

- There are different types of hazard analysis, one is checklist analysis, non-scenario based. This involves 3 steps, checklist needs to be decided, then should be carried out, then results should be documented. It contains the equipment subsection - checking for design codes for equipment if met, corrosion, labelling, and a safety equipment subsection - fire safety equipment adequacy, gas sampling equipment.

# HAZOP

- Another type of hazard analysis is HAZOP, a scenario based method. First you select equipment node, then give a keyword to define the scenario e.g. high temperature, then think about what causes the scenario, then associate consequences and identify safeguards, then actions would be provided to avoid the scenario. Typical scenario keywords are temperature, pressure, flow rate and composition. Risk = event severity x event probability

- A voluntary risk is conscious undertaking of a risk for self-benefit (e.g. athlete, smoking) whilst involuntary is imposed risk with lack of self-benefit (e.g. 2nd hand smoke, cancer causing foods). Process safety looks at the high consequence, low probability events and takes into account both voluntary and involuntary risk situations whilst personal safety is the low consequence high probability events (e.g. trips, slips and falls).

- In safety regulation, a code is a set of rules made often by professionals, standards are more detailed explanations of how to follow the codes and regulations are rules made by government and can often be based on codes/standards.

- Low consequence, low probability events are unimportant so can be eliminated from focus using tools such as risk matrix - provide risk levels based on severity and probability.

- Safeguards in respond are put in place to prevent dangerous event from occurring. Safeguards between the initial event and loss of containment are called preventative safeguards (e.g. alarms/polling systems), whilst safeguards that aim to prevent the overall consequence/reduce the impact are called mitigating safeguards.

- The Swiss cheese model is important for showing we donâ€™t want all safeguards to fail so not all can align as in not all can fail in the same way.

- The bowtie model has similar goals, shows how we want more preventative safeguards, the more the better.
