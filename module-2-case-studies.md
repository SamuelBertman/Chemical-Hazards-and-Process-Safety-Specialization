# Williams Geismar Olefins Plant Explosion Case Study

Issues that led to the incident: the reboiler was blocked in and filled with liquid propane (flammable), there was no valve to relieve pressure, when propane was released, its flammability caused it to ignite. Methods that would have prevented the situation are the checklist method which would have ensured a proper relief system and would’ve made sure the reboiler was safely isolated. The HAZOP would have examined the no-flow scenario and addressed it and also would’ve analysed the risk of thermal expansion.

# Piper Alpha Case Study

Pump A was taken out of service and temporarily sealed with a hand-bolted metal cap. Paperwork stating it shouldn't be used was left in the control room instead of being handed to the manager . When Pump B later failed, there was a power outage risk so the manager, unaware of the risk with no paperwork stating otherwise, restarted Pump A. This caused a pressure build up leading to gas escaping which ignited. The explosion destroyed the non-blast-proof control room, disabling evacuation protocols, and fire suppression systems were off due to divers in the water (Swiss cheese method not followed here). 167 people died. The added gas processing unit increased explosion risk due to higher pressure and flammability.
