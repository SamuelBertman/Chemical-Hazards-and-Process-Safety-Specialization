## risk types within the chemical industry

- chemical risks:  
  toxicity, side reactions, flammability, biohazardous risk

- equipment risks:  
  high temps, high pressures, mechanical hazards, vessel entry requirement for maintenance

## features of positive safety cultures

- should be a core value (reinforced e.g. safety moment at start of meetings)  
- responsibilities should be clear (documentation and evaluation)  
- leadership should provide resources and support safety personnel  
- mechanisms to periodically evaluate safety culture (e.g. performance indicators)  
- awareness to process hazards + warning signs  
- personnel should be trained in all aspects of roles + thus deferment is possible  
- effective communication + consistency + mechanism of report  
- supported to report mistakes + stop work for safety  
- organisation should respond and enact response in good time w/ appropriate personnel

## methods for evaluating chemical processes

- what hazards, what could go wrong - impact result  
- how often to recur - risk  
- how to control/manage
