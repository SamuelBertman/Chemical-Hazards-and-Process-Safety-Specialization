. line of questioning in evaluation - what hazards, what could go wrong - impact result, how often to recur - risk - how to control/manage
. chemical risks - toxicity, side reactions, flammability, biohazardous risk
  equipment risks - high temps, high pressures, mechanical hazards, vessel entry requirement for       maintenance 
. positive safety culture - should be a core value (reinforced e.g. safety moment at start of meetings), responsibilities should be clear (documentation and evaluation), leadership should provide resources and support safety personnel, 
  mechanisms to periodically evaluate safety culture (e.g. performance indicators), awareness to process hazards + warning signs, personnel should be trained in all aspects of roles + thus deferment is possible, effective communication + consistency + mechanism of report, 
  supported to report mistakes + stop work for safety, organisation should respond and enact response in good time w/ appropriate personnel
