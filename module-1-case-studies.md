## Bhopal Disaster
- Killed thousands and injured more as a result of issues in safety processes, unnecessary storage of intermediate reactants, and highlighted environmental and health impacts of unsafe and unregulated chemical storage.
- Led to the introduction of regulation laws and the establishment of the Chemical Safety Board (CSB).
- Following events showed more prevention measures still need to be put in place.

**What can be taken away:**  
- Importance of regulatory checks  
- Need for emergency response planning  
- Importance of risk assessments  

These are a must in future upkeep.

## Alcoa
- Made focus to have a zero-incident policy following the death of a worker.
- Oâ€™Neill admitted fault, analyzed all that went wrong, and improved on it.
- Then put effort into looking at other incidents to prevent repeats.

**What can be taken away:**  
- Importance of reporting incidents for future prevention  
- Safety procedures  
- Ensuring a safety-focused environment  

Future must involve advocating for defined responsibilities, ongoing training in safety processes, and good communication.
