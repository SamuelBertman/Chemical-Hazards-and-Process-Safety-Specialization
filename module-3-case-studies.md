## Deepwater Horizon Case Study 

The Deepwater Horizon had many safeguards in place, the BOP, blind shear rams and the AMF Deadman system. AMF Deadman however failed due to series and parallel failure mechanisms including loss of hydraulic pressure, a dead battery, solenoid malfunction and misalignment of the drill pipe. The prevention of the blind shear rams from sealing the well caused the blowout to occur.
